Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fud is a Yelp-like application that lets you rate food items at a restaurant 
as opposed to the restaurant itself.  No more combing through reviews for 
recommendations, now you can just search directly for the best burger in 
the city! 

Fud's data was generated manually and randomly when possible.  Because of the
tedious nature of this task, we focused mainly on collecting restaurants for 
the 10027 and 10036 zipcodes and generating reviews for burgers, shakes, and 
fries (naturally).

Fud is a web application (link below) that utilizes Flask and related tools 
for web dev and postgres as its DBMS.
